# PDE5 inhibition and Alzheimer’s disease risk: a mendelian randomisation study

**Background**: While preclinical studies suggest that Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibition may reduce cognitive impairment, findings from observational studies on whether PDE5 inhibitors reduce Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk have been inconsistent.

**Objective**: To perform a two-sample *cis*-Mendelian randomisation analysis to estimate the effect of PDE5 inhibition on AD risk.
